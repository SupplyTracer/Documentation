# Abstract

SupplyTracer aims to build B2C B2B supply chain platform upon public blockchain. 
Using the platform, consumers can easily validate commercial goods identity,
while centralized and decentralized financial institutes can obtain invoice for (collateral) loans.

# Technical Issues

The platform will be implemented as a dapp in EOS (Enterprise Operating System), which support at least 1000 tx/s 
and scales up easily. Most importantly, the community of EOS will bring lots of dapps and users.

# Economic Issues

After first round development, we will distribute dapp token (SupplyToken) to eos holders and dapp installers. EOS token 
will be currency used for supply info storage, but fees income from dapp will buy SupplyToken from market monthly and 
burn out.

The token supply will be 1.4 billion, airdrops for eos holders and dapp installers will be 1 billion. The rest 0.4 
billion will be used for dapp development and business cooperation.
